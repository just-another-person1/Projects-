This project uses OpenCV to leverage the power of computer vision, allowing users to play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer opponent. 
Using the OpenCV library, this project employs image processing techniques to capture and analyze hand gestures in real-time. 
Users can interact with the system's webcam by making gestures with their hands, and the computer will respond with its own randomly generated choice, and then processes the data to decide a winner.
